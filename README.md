# Windows Audio Session Controller

## Introduction

This is just an example how to control the volume of apps in the Windows mixer. I could not find a simple example so I built one myself.

## Get Started

### Windows

To clone and create the project, open a command prompt and proceed as follows:

```
git clone https://www.github.com/rehans/win-audio-session-controller.git
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../win-audio-session-controller
cmake --build .
```
